1. With the switch off, measure the voltages:
    * Accross the resistor RC.  0.13MV
    * At the collector (C).  2.69
    * At the base (B).  0.03
    * At the emitter (E). 0.02
    * Record these voltages in the README.
2. With the switch off, measure the currents:
    * The collector current IC. 0.1V
    * The emitter current IE. 2.7mv
    * The base current IB.Â If this current is not zero, you are doing something wrong :) 5.7 ma
    * Record these currents in the README. Does any current flow?
